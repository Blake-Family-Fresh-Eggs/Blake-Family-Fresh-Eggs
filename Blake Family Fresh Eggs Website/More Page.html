        <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic"><strong>The chicken breeds/strains we have here:</strong><br>
      Ameraucana, Littau Partridge Brahma, White Sultan, and Leghorn.      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Pictured below is the chicken complex.</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: left;"><strong>Where our chickens live:<br>
      </strong>      <span style="font-style: italic">Pictured above is the Chicken Complex. The Chicken Complex is where all of our chickens live. It is very spacious, and they have access to clean water inside and out of the coop, thanks to our watering cup system. The chickens have access to a feeder inside the coop which they can access any time of the day. The chickens also have 2 seperate runs we rotate them on so they always have access to fresh greens. We also let our chickens out of the run every day, so they can search the old garden for bugs and other delicious snacks.</span>      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Pictured below are the Ameraucana chickens eating when they were young.</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic"><strong>Why the Brahma chickens we have don't have the same coloring as traditional Brahmas:</strong><br>
        The three Brahma chickens we have here have the partridge coloring. 
      This is because they are from the Littau's. The Littau's breed these Brahmas with the special partridge coloring. You can see examples of the partridge coloring in the &quot;Meet The Chickens&quot; page.      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic"><strong>How we get naturally colored blue and green Seahawk Eggs:</strong><br>
        It is all about the breed. Ameraucana chickens naturally lay blue and green eggs. And they are not alone. There are other breeds that lay colorful eggs, and there is even another breed that also lays blue and green eggs.      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic"><strong>How we keep our chickens safe:</strong><br>
        Chickens need protection, especially here, where there are 
      many predators. Coyotes, bears, and raccoons to name a few. So, how do we keep the chickens safe from them? There are many things we do to keep them protected. First of all, the entire chicken complex is inside 2 layers of fence. Secondly, the fencing of both chicken runs is dug into the ground, and covered on the top. This prevents any ground predators from digging in, and any aerial predators from diving in. Additionally, the chicken coop is made out of metal, so nothing is getting through that. </p>
